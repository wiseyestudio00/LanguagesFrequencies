# LanguagesFrequencies

This project contains the appearance frequencies of different characters from many different lanaguages.

Reference texts are collected from various sources: Wikipedia, novels, news, and many others.

Made with no license. Free for any usage.

Notice: I tried my best to arbitrarily select the texts. However, bias still exists. The data base is way too small for serious research purposes.
